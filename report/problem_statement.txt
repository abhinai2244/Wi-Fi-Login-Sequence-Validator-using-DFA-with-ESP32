PROBLEM STATEMENT
=================

In modern web-based and IoT authentication systems, the login process
requires users to follow a strict sequence of steps:

  1. Enter a valid username
  2. Enter a valid password
  3. Submit the credentials

However, many systems do not enforce the order of these steps at the
protocol level. This can lead to:

  - Submitting a form without entering a username
  - Entering a password before the username
  - Submitting without providing any credentials
  - Bypassing steps through direct API manipulation

These invalid sequences can create security vulnerabilities, unexpected
system states, and poor user experience.

PROBLEM:
  How can we formally validate that a login process follows the correct
  sequence of input steps, and reject any deviation immediately?

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
  This project uses a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) to model and
  enforce the login sequence. The DFA provides:

  - A mathematically proven model for sequence validation
  - Immediate rejection of invalid input orders
  - Clear, deterministic behavior for every possible input
  - No ambiguity in state transitions

  The DFA is implemented on an ESP32 microcontroller that operates as
  a Wi-Fi Access Point with a web-based login interface. Each user
  action is mapped to a DFA input symbol, and the transition function
  determines whether to proceed or reject the attempt.

  This approach bridges the gap between formal automata theory and
  practical embedded system design, demonstrating real-world applicability
  of computer science fundamentals.
