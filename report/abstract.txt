Wi-Fi Login Sequence Validator using Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)

This project presents a Wi-Fi login authentication system that validates
the login process using Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) rules, running
on an ESP32 microcontroller.

In conventional login systems, input sequence validation is often handled
through ad-hoc conditional logic. This project instead employs a formal
DFA model to enforce the correct order of operations during authentication:
username entry → password entry → submit.

The ESP32 operates as a Wi-Fi Access Point and hosts a web-based login page.
When a user interacts with the login form, each action (entering a username,
entering a password, clicking submit) is mapped to a DFA input symbol.
The DFA engine on the ESP32 processes these symbols through its transition
function, moving between states Q0 (Idle), Q1 (Username Entered),
Q2 (Password Entered), Q3 (Login Successful), and QE (Error).

If the user follows the correct sequence (u → p → s), the DFA reaches
its accepting state Q3 and the login is successful. Any deviation from
the expected sequence transitions the DFA to the error state QE,
immediately rejecting the login attempt.

This approach demonstrates how formal language theory and automata concepts
can be practically applied to embedded IoT systems, providing a structured,
predictable, and mathematically grounded validation mechanism.
